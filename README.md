# Modular-ROV
Current dumping ground for all updates on my personal ROV project

an ROV made entirely made of easily swappable modules, with dynamic module and sensor detection, designed to be able to hypothetically host an infinite number of modules. currrent limit is 248 due to programming restraints of the arduino Wire library
